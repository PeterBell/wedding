# Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

## But really... A camp!?

Yes! There's dirt and trees and _everything_. There will be bonfires, canoeing, crafts, a ropes course...all the things you did at summer camp, or at least saw in movies. Don't worry: it's not _too_ rustic: there's still walls and hot meals and toilets.

## I have mobility issues - will I be able to get around?

There are handicap-accessible rooms - make sure we are aware if you need one of these. We will also have access to golf carts to get you around camp.

## Is the camp able to accommodate food allergies or specific dietary restrictions?

Yes! You'll let us know when you RSVP.

## What about bringing kids?

Absolutely! There are plenty of cabins if you need privacy for breastfeeding or want to sequester your toddler.

## I can’t stay for the whole weekend - can I still come?

Yep!

## So uh, what is 'camp formal'? What do I wear to the ceremony?

Not jeans, but [not heels]({{site.baseurl}}/#what-not-to-bring).

# Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

## A camp!?

Yes! There's dirt and trees and _everything_. There will be bonfires, canoeing, crafts, a ropes course...all the things you did at summer camp, or at least saw in movies. Don't worry: it's not _too_ rustic: there's still walls and hot meals and toilets.

## I have mobility issues - will I be able to get around?

There are handicap-accessible rooms - make sure we are aware if you need one of these. We will also have access to golf carts to get you around camp.

## Are kids allowed?

Absolutely! There are plenty of cabins if you need privacy for breastfeeding or want to sequester your toddler.

## I canâ€™t stay for the whole weekend - can I still come?

Yep!

## Food and lodging

This is a kids' summer camp, and we have the whole thing for the whole weekend! We will be staying in enclosed cabins with full bathrooms and twin beds, 4-6 people per cabin. Staying at camp is strongly encouraged, but you are welcome to find a hotel or Airbnb nearby. We'll be asking for money from attendees to cover the cost of the lodging and non-reception meals, but only if it's not a burden for you financially.

We will be having meals at camp for Friday dinner through Sunday brunch. We would love to have you the full weekend, but understand if you need to arrive late or leave early.

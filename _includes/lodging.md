## Camp details

"That's all well and good," you're thinking, while also simultaneously lamenting how strange young people are these days. "Would a nice ballroom be too much to ask? Real talk, where _am_ I sleeping? Will I need to fight off bears? What **is** this place?"

Glad you asked. Let's get into the nitty gritty. When it's not catering to the marital whims of fanciful Brooklynites, Camp Timber Tops is an all girls sleepaway summer camp. It's full of dirt and trees and all the stuff that makes camp camp.

But never fear! You'll be staying in fully enclosed cabins with running water and indoor toilets and showers. Pillows, linens, and towels will also be provided, plus we'll keep you fed and protected with all the snacks, sunscreen, and bug spray you need.

Need to keep the family of four together? Need to _not_ room with your brother? Let us know about any specific bunking needs when you RSVP.

Still can't stomach the idea of staying at camp? There are hotels and Airbnb options nearby, but we'll hope you'll reconsider. Please reach out if we can help put your mind at ease about staying with us for the weekend.
